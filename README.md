### User POV:

#### User Access:

- User navigates to /chat on the Exper dApp.
- A popup suggests prepaying to access AI models.

#### Prepayment Process:

- User interacts with a treasury smart contract to prepay for access.
- Funds are securely transferred to the treasury.

#### AI Model Interaction:

- Behind the scenes, a RAG model (Reformulated Advisory Group) is employed.
- Vector store fetches appropriate embeddings for user queries.

### Data Contributor:

#### Onboarding:

- Data contributor visits /onboard page.
- Submits name, email, and description.

#### ExperDAO Verification:

- ExperDAO verifiers review and approve the membership application.
- Contributor is whitelisted to mint a DAO NFT pass.

#### NFT Minting:

- Contributor mints a DAO NFT pass used for token gating and voting within the DAO.

#### Data Contribution:

- Contributor submits data for inclusion in the RAG model.
- Data undergoes approval processes to ensure quality and relevance.

#### Data Processing:

- Approved data is split and converted into vector embeddings.
- Embeddings are processed using Mistral for LLM (Large Language Model) and BERT for embeddings.

#### Data Storage:

- Vector embeddings are stored in Vectorstore, facilitated by Supabase.
- Smart contracts manage data transactions and interactions on the UBIT chain.
